            <p>Hello, my name is Oto-obong Effiong. I'm a front-end web developer
                 based in Abuja, Nigeria. I'm interested in web performance, accessibility 
                 and creating striking visuals. I work with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                 I focus on keeping my code clean and efficient, and I make it a habit to 
                 stay up to date on current best practices. I currently specialize in front-end 
                 development but Iâ€™m slowly learning the ropes of back-end.
            </p>
            <p>I have only done a handful of web projects, but in the near future I am determined
                 to get many more projects under my belt that I can show off. This portfolio will 
                 show all of my progress through projects. 
            </p>
